# General Information 
  The editor allows you to combine and modify long texts from multiple sources of all inputs, outputs, flags, tags, timers, etc. It generates a file .csv ready to     load into Kuka KRC4 robot. The biggest goal of this editor was to have something that allows you to combine descriptions of signals from many sources such as       E-plan, application folder (provided by the client), robot programs and file .xlsm with multiple sheets (provided by plc developers).   

# Technologies Used 
  - Python - version 3.8.5,
  - MySQL - version 8.0.25,
  - PyQt5 - version 5.15.2,
  - openpyxl - version 3.0.7,
  - mysql-connector-python - version 8.0.27.
 
# Features
List the ready features here:
- Standard features such as New, Open, Save, Save as, and Exit.  
- Create new database - this feature allows you to create a new database called Signals. If you want to create a new database, you only need to slect a folder with all csv files with long texts for each application. This  folder should be provided by by the client.
- Add application - this feature allows you to add descriptions of the selected application (such as welding, handling, etc.). These descriptions come from the created database.
- Remove application - this feature allows you to remove descriptions of the selected application. 
- Add markers from .src file - this function allows you to add descriptions of markers contained in a .src file. It is important to have a comment before defining the marker in the file. src, because the description of this marker depends on the comment line. For example:   
 -- Teilkontrollen alle frei --,
 M21 = !E645 & !E647.              
 The editor will create the name of the marker M21 as "Teilkontrollen alle frei ".
- Add flags from .src file - this function allows you to add descriptions of flags contained in a .src file. It is important to have a comment before defining the flag in the file. src, because the description of this flag depends on the comment line. For example:           
++ Anwahl Stapel 1 BH1 ++, F931 = !E57 & E63 & E233.         
The editor will create the name of the flag F931 as "Anwahl Stapel 1 BH1".
- Add signals from .asc file - this function allows you to add descriptions of signals contained in the selected file .asc. This file mainly contains didgital inputs and outputs descriptions of hndling application and is generated by E-Plan. One line of a such file looks like this: 
200040R01G01KKP11R,"A590","BOOL ","False","False","False","Spanner zurück","","False".    
The editor will create the name of the digital output DO590 as "G01KKP11R Spanner zurück".
- Add signals from .xlsm file - this function allows you to add descriptions of signals contained in the selected file. xlsm and the selected worksheet. This file mainly contains several sheets with descriptions of digital inputs and outputs for communication with a master PLC.
